# J.O-Planner-App

- I have designed the Planner App using day.js time format.
- The user is able to write different activities that they would be involved in on a daily basis from 9-5pm.
- When the user clicks and writes on the text area they are able to save to the local storage and it is saved.
- Please see below screenshot for final work.
